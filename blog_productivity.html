        <h2>Personal productivity hacks</h2> 
      
      <p>I was committing a serious crime. I was killing my dreams for a few extra hours in bed. After I quit my full-time job I was sucked into a spiral of lethargy. There was no progress on projects I wished to work on. I was picking projects quick and abandoning them quicker.
    </p>
      <p>Just loving what you do is not fulfilling. Fulfilment is also driven by control you exert over your time. Effectively controlling your limited time to produce meaningful work is productivity.
    </p>
      <p>My need to become productive led me to research the internet(mostly binging YouTube). Sharing the learnings below which transformed my life.
    </p>
      <p>
          <ul>
              <li>Good night's sleep: Being productive boils down to making right choices. Quality of choices depends on how well rested your brain is. My mood was murkier and meals were unhealthier on days when I slept for less than 7 hours. First step to productivity is fixing your sleep. Every other hack will follow.
            </li>
            <li>To-do list: Nothing dampens motivation like waking up with uncertainty about how you will spend your day. Conjuring tasks every other hour quickly tires your brain, hence reducing productivity. Create next day's to-do list a night before and assign time slots to it.
            </li>
            <li>Build a routine: Man is a creature of habit. Human mind developed habits to reserve brain share for unprecedented events. Sticking to a routine eliminates requirement of willpower for success. Your brain switches to auto-pilot mode and navigates through tasks effortlessly.
            </li>
            <li>Structure your day: Identify the time when your creative juices overflow or your mind is at its sharpest. Utilise those slots for work which requires singular focus. Activities such as research, meetings and checking emails can be moved to lazy post-meal slots.
            </li>
            <li>Set up directional surroundings: My to-do list on a whiteboard is visible as soon as I wake up. A notebook with a blank page open near my computer serves a constant reminder to create something daily. I keep my phone at least two arm lengths away and absent from my sight while I work. Set up an environment which takes away the burden of decisions off your shoulders.
            </li>
            <li>Walking daily: Constant bombardment of information in your brain by external stimuli leaves little to no time for original thinking. I walk everyday at a set time to let thoughts collide and retrospect my progress for the day. This habit keeps me fit, both physically and mentally.
            </li>

          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>A one system fit all doesn't exist. If you are experiencing a slump then begin small. Pick one activity which adds value to your life. Repeat it everyday at the same time until it becomes a habit. Once the habit sets in stone, add a new one. Consistent self-paced efforts yield results.
