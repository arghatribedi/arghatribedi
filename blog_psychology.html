        <h2>Learnings from Psychology</h2>

        <p>I read multiple books in the last 2 months mostly revolving around psychology. My top learnings are as followed:   </p>

        <p>Earlier generations labored physically at a location where workers left their work behind at 5pm. Today, 41% of the employees are designated as managers, officers or professionals. Now, when you design a marketing campaign, you don’t clock out. You carry your job in your head while driving, cooking or even sleeping. Previous generations might be poorer than us but were happier. Control over your time is a key influencer of happiness. Only financial independence can help you regain control over how your spend your time.</p>

        <p>End of reality illusion is a psychological illusion in which a person believes that he/she has experienced significant change in taste and desires up-to the present moment but will not change going forward. In simple terms, people – not old enough to drink – pick jobs early in their career and believe that they will still enjoy it when they are enrolling kids in coding classes. In a world where people change over time, we often make ourselves prisoners to our past. It’s equivalent to a stranger making your life decisions. Embrace the idea that goals made when you were different person can be abandoned. Move on asap and minimize the future regret.</p>

        <p>Psychologist Samuel Gosling conducted an experiment in which 80 college students filled up the Big Five inventory(self personality scale). Friends and strangers were allowed to guess the self-reported personality scores of the college students. But the strangers were allowed 15 minutes inside the dorm room of the students. Who do you think were more accurate in predicting the personality traits? A person’s bedroom gives three clues about his/her personality: how he/she would like to be seen by the world (a degree hanging from your wall), person’s behavioral nature (wardrobe arranged by color) and how does the person regulate his/her feelings(aroma diffuser). A stranger can learn so much more about a person just by a glance at his/her private space than a friend can ever learn from hours of looking at the person’s public face.</p>

        <p>A giant pyramid is inverted and balanced over a Rs.2000 note. How do you remove the note without disturbing or toppling the pyramid? Psychologist Jonathan Schooler challenged two groups with this problem with other insight problems. He found that the group which was asked to write down or verbalize their approach and strategy solved 30% fewer problems than the group which depended only on instinctive thinking. (Btw answer is burning the note). Problem solving moved from right brain(thinks in images) to left brain(thinks in words). Hence, great leaders do not ask you to explain yourselves constantly. They provide guidance and intent but never intricate orders. They trust subordinates to use their initiative and be innovative.</p>
