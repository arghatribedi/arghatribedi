                <h2>Rework</h2>
                <h3 style="font-weight: lighter;">Jason Fried,  David Heinemeier Hansson</h3>
                <p>"Delegators are dead weight for a small team. When they run out work to assign - they make up more."

                    I read a no-nonsense business book called #Rework authored by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson. Unlike other business books which can just be a tweet, this short book is a series of knowledge nuggets. Every piece of advice is supported by examples from author's successful business or other known companies. Every chapter offers practical actions which can be implemented right away. Writers have not minced words in calling out pointless activities at workplaces.
                    
                    This book has something for both kind of professionals: 9-to-5er and entrepreneur. I had picked up few learnings in my jobs and reading them here was interesting. I might make wallpapers out of the impactful quotes from this book. If you are looking forward to a productive weekend, pick up this business manual and highlight the hell out of it.
                    </p>
                <p>My favourite quotes:
                    "Stop imagining what’s going to work. Find out for real."
                    "All companies have customers. Lucky companies have fans. But the most fortunate companies have audiences."
                    "An “I” apology is a lot stronger than a “we” apology."</p>

                <h2>The Psychology of Money</h2>
                <h3 style="font-weight: lighter;">Morgan Housel</h3>
                <p>You think you want fame? No, you just want the admiration of other people.
                   You think you want to be rich? No, you just want to control how you spend your time.                
                   You think you need a fancy job title? No, you just want to sleep better after a day of fulfilling work.
                   Psychology of Money, the life changing book for me, quashed my presumptions(listed above) in 2020. Talking about being at the right place at the right time, I found this book at my lowest. I struggled with finding the right direction to steer my career at. Ideas such as power of compounding, attainment of financial freedom & vacuity of material success have left an ever lasting impact on me. I'll be indebted to Morgan Housel for writing this. This book should be a pre-requisite for adulting.</p>
                <p>My favorite quote from the book: (Financial) Independence, to me, doesn't mean you'll stop working. It means you only do the work you like with people you like at the times you want for as long as you want.</p>

                <h2>Range: How Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World</h2>
                <h3 style="font-weight: lighter;">David Epstein</h3>
                <p>My friends have often advised me against sifting through multiple career options. Society frowns upon jack of all trades.

                    Range by David Epstein has made me feel comfortable in the idea of becoming a generalist. This book presented impactful examples such as Roger Federer who discovered multiple sports before specializing in tennis.
                    
                    A generalist is better equipped at solving problems in an area structurally similar to another field of interest. Prime example being Geneticists and Microbiologists excelling in computer networks. Companies also imbibed the idea in their talent search by testing candidates with guesstimation. It's an effective method to test structural thinking instead of just knowledge.
                    
                    Late specialization in the world which demands hyper-specialization is perfectly normal. Do not claim to be finished when you are a work in progress (from Gilbert).</p>
                <p>My favorite quote from the book: If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.</p>
