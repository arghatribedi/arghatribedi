        <h2>Advice for Millenial Workers</h2> 
       <p>On envy: I envied others but found a way to curb it. How many times have you caught yourself envying a colleague travelling the world, a friend securing a handsomely paying job or entrepreneurs minting billions. A simple way to stop being envious is to imagine swapping your lives with the person you envy. Complete lives. Their parents, their birthplace, their childhood, their education, their relationships, their prior financial conditions, their health, their beliefs. If you can make through broke 20s, difficult relationships, financial uncertainty, constant social media criticism,100 hour work weeks for years, then please go ahead envy Elon Musk.</p>
       <p>On starting: Gear does not matter, 'to get started'. You don't need a: Nike Vaporfly to start running, Gold Gym membership to start building muscles or Headspace subscription to start meditating. Refrain from identifying efforts as burning a hole in your pocket.</p>
       <p>On presenting: If you are starting a Dosa joint, what would you worry about first: font scheme of the menu, color of the seating furniture or recipe of your Dosa? I know your answer. But sadly, most people start decks (if PowerPoint presentations had a street name) with color scheme and funny icons in their mind. Is your deck anything without a finalized story-like content? Lock the content down, then unlock your creativity. Not the other way round.</p>
       <p>On shifting careers: Test drive before buying a car is inevitable. Speaking to locals before buying a house in the locality is almost unavoidable. Watching less than 50 reviews on YouTube before upgrading your phone is deemed stupidity. But professionals rush into new careers without a trial. Work on weekends to check if your newly found passion is a real spark or just a phase. Before jumping into a new fad career, make time to network and speak to people who are actually doing the job. Does it still sound as fancy as it seems?</p>
