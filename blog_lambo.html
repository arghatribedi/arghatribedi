    <h2>Your Lamborghini is on my TV</h2>
    
    <p>A quote which hit me during my teens was –

        Lamborghini doesn’t do commercials because their target market isn’t sitting around watching TV.</p>

    <p>I want to put forward a case against this notion.

        Physiologist Ivan Pavlov trained his dog to salivate with a ring of bell. This is a classical case of conditioning used by advertisers to make consumers associate a chilled beer with relaxed day on a beach. These ads are also known as lifestyle ads. Next time you go beer shopping, a glance at this brand’s product will rush in positive emotions attached to it.</p>
        
    <p>But Pavlovian training alone doesn’t make lifestyle ads effective. A social component is in play too. Most people claim that mass media doesn’t influence them but influences other people. This is termed as ‘third-person-effect’. You decide to buy some beer for a party you have been invited to. When you see the brand in the super market, you believe you are not influenced by the ad you saw, but other people might be. So it makes sense to show up with the same brand which might appeal to your friends. The lifestyle ad has successfully influenced you through your peers.</p>
        
    <p>By the virtue of third person effect, few brands create envy by advertising to both potential and non-potential buyers. An upcoming luxury brand’s mass media ads targeted at buyers who cannot afford it will influence potential buyers too. The rich will be assured that the ads have been widely circulated and the poor has been trained to appreciate it as a status symbol. It sounds manipulative but it works. Ads by luxury cars in movies and music videos are long standing experiments of third person effect.</p>
