        <h2>My experience with recruiters</h2> 
        
        <p>Recruiting managers can be the new relationship managers. Hiring process is a two way street. Both parties benefit from it. For most candidates, a recruiter offers first peek into the company culture. Like they say, first impressions are last.</p>
        <p>I shut off recruiters who negotiate the pay excessively on the first call instead of checking if the role is a good fit for me. This creates an impression that the company is more concerned in closing low cost deals than hiring right (or taking best decisions).</p>
        <p>Also, when I mention that I quit my previous job due to personal reasons, some recruiters continue probing. I believed personal implied ‘private’ reasons. If you want to know if I was laid off, then just ask! This behaviour suggests company’s lack of trust in its employees.</p>
        <p>This is not rant. I just wanted to voice my interpretations of few calls I received. I am sure others will have different stories.</p>
