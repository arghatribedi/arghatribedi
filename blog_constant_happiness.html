        <h2>Achieving constant happiness</h2> 
      <p>A YouTube video taught me more about happiness than all self help books combined. 

        Buying an expensive dress, consuming sugar laden food or garnering 1,000 likes on holiday pictures feels joyous. But this joy is temporary. Contentment comes from creating something. I chased contentment.</p>
      <p>Last year I spent days designing websites and apps. One such day I watched a YouTube video in which a person designed a cool website. Unlike typical design videos, he developed the website too. I was amazed. Contrary to my preconception that building a website is complex, I found his process fairly simple. 
    </p>
      <p>Quick search revealed that HTML and CSS are heart and soul of all websites. So I approached my coach and mentor YouTube to educate me. Numerous creators on YouTube mentioned that project based learning is the best approach to start coding. So armed with basics of HTML and CSS, I began replicating simple websites from the internet. 
    </p>
      <p>After spending a month cloning random websites with Stack Overflow's help, I was ready to embark on a real project. I decided to build a personal website. Designing it was easy but building it took me two months(front-end developers reading this, please don't judge my pace). It took many iterations to adjust the site appearance across all browser types and sizes. 
    </p>
      <p>I finally shipped the website last week. Dopamine which surged after hitting "publish site" is still lingering in my brain. The sense of happiness and motivation I received by shipping a website is inexpressible.
    </p>
      <p>I received two benefits from self learning web development. First, internet became more real for me. Now internet is not just an information provider but also an enabler for my ideas. Second, putting efforts to learn and apply new skills has rekindled my confidence to deal with change. I am more comfortable in shifting industries and learning new tricks from scratch. Learn something today!
