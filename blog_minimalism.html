        <h2>Minimalism changed my life</h2> 
      
       <p>Daily hunt for toothpaste in college hostel has set me up for success. Minimalism is the art of achieving more in less. It was popularised by a 2016 Netflix documentary. Millionaire youtubers are preaching this lifestyle. But our college life exemplified minimalism better than the internet. Every college-goer is a situational minimalist. Students complete assessments with limited study material, organise parties by crowdsourcing supplies and attend interviews with only three neck-ties per hostel wing. 

        Applying college lifestyle in my later life has yielded following advantages:</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                
            <li>Decluttered living environment - Do you really need 11 pairs of footwear in your closet? How many do you actively use? Retain few which spark joy(Konmari method) and donate rest.
            </li>
            <li>Reduced carbon footprint - It can take upto 2,700 litres water to produce the cotton needed to make a single t-shirt. Curbing the urge to buy every pretty dress on Amazon conserves the real amazon(rainforest).
            </li>
            <li>Mitigated paradox of choice - Each morning we spend valuable time choosing an outfit from fifty options. Limiting the wardrobe and picking the outfits for the week on Sunday saves time.
            </li>
            <li>Provided flexibility in movement - As a young professional, bogging yourself down with excessive material possessions such as appliances, furniture and a car resist your movement across locations, hence limiting career opportunities. Instead, leverage the shared economy.
            </li>

        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>In short, minimalism unmasks the why behind your desires. Procure items which you actually require, not which society influences you to. Time and cash are limited. Spend them on experiences, not products.
