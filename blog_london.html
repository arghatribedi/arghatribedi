        <h2>Designated Survivors: London</h2>

        <p>In the years leading to world war II British government feared that German warplanes will target London and
            cause major destruction. In 1937 authorities predicted a loss of 600,000 lives and injury of 1.2 million
            people just within London. A mass exodus of 4M Londoners towards countryside was expected. Industries were
            expected to come to a halt. Government set up multiple psychiatric centers in the city to take care of the
            upcoming wave of psychological casualties. Government had even planned to build an underground tunnel
            network only to drop the idea later thinking that people who take shelter underground might never come out
            again.</p>

        <p>The anticipated bombing began in 1940. German airforce bombed London for 8 months. There was destruction everywhere. A million houses destroyed, 46,000 people dead, another 46,000 wounded but the London spirit wasn’t killed. People carried on with their daily chores outside. Even with wreckage around, pavements were full of Londoners haggling at shops; streets were filled with enthusiastic kids. Psychiatric centers remained empty and were later converted to military bunkers. As German assault grew stronger few people were evacuated to the countryside but by and large most people stayed back. Government was astonished at the resilience of Londoners.

        </p>

        <p>A Canadian psychiatrist, John T. MacCurdy explained why bombing never affected London like it was supposed to. According to him when bomb falls, it divides the affected population into 3 groups. The first group is the people killed. The next group is ‘near misses’ who feel the blast, are shocked and probably wounded. Third group is ‘remote misses’ who hear the bombs blasting ,sirens, ambulances from a the next block but the bombs never directly hit them. After 2 or 3 times it happens, the remote misses consider themselves invincible. 46,000 deaths spread across a city of 8M created more remote misses than any other group. MacCurdy summarizes remote miss feeling as “a sense of excitement with a flavor of invulnerability”.

        </p>

        <p>Now imagine if the modern world is plagued with a life threatening pandemic, will you expect most people who can stay inside the safety of their houses to stay indoors or otherwise?
