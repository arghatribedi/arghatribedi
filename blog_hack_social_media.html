        <h2>Hack your social media</h2> 
       <p>Which is higher? Number of crows in India or number of articles calling social media the devil. I am not using your screen space to blame social media. It has its de-merits but you can hack it (in a non-malicious way) for your benefit. A year back, when I was severely over-weight, a college friend took me under his wings. He got me hooked to healthy eating and running.</p>
       <p>Running was difficult to start and harder to continue. At this point, social media worked like fuel for me. I dabbled with a few running videos to correct my technique. More I watched, more of my feed was occupied by similar content. As they say, we become what we consume. After realizing the effect I instantly started following a lot of runners and running club pages on Instagram. Constantly seeing people running on every social media platform kept pushing me to run more.</p>
       <p>My point - if you want to learn art, unfollow all so called ‘influencers’ and only follow artists. Train the recommendation algorithm to work in your favour.</p>
