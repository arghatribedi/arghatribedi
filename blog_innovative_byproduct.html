        <h2>Innovative By-Product</h2> 
       <p>I trained 1,500+ employees on storyboarding business-presentations. Most of them comprised fresh recruits who learnt the skill as part of their induction training program.</p>
       <p>Problem arose when multiple students, then billed employees, requested me to review their actual client presentations. After reviews I realized that though basics of storyboarding were few, multiple employees had forgotten them. I decided to build communities to solve this rampant problem.</p>
       <p>I helped and re-trained the first few employees who approached me. I encouraged them to work with any new requestor from their account before approaching me. This community grew and worked like a charm. New trainers were effective with industry-specific feedbacks. Quality of presentations improved across the organization. My workload declined.</p>
       <p>Remember, when you make something, you make something else too. I primarily trained recruits but also enabled the creation of communities. Stay observant to spot any opportunity to create a by-product.</p>
