        <h2>Run productive meetings</h2> 
        
    
    <p>I have worked with leaders who spend a full working day in meetings only. External demand of their time is so high that they have to book their own calendars to spare time for meals. In a situation like this, the meeting organizer shoulders a responsibility of running a productive meeting. Few tips:</p>
    <p>One, always send a meeting agenda in advance: Let participants decide the mode of communication after reading the agenda. How many times have you wondered that a meeting could have been just an email? If point of an hour long meeting is to collect updates, emails or 10-minute standups will suffice.</p>
    <p>Two, conduct action oriented meetings: 80% of meetings I attended were in "let's discuss that" format. Change it to "let's decide that" format. Weigh opinions, settle on an action item and assign it to a participant.</p>
    <p>Three, conduct action oriented meetings: 80% of meetings I attended were in "let's discuss that" format. Change it to "let's decide that" format. Weigh opinions, settle on an action item and assign it to a participant.</p>
